Gephardt benefits from the nation's generally apathy towards four more years of Republican governance.<br><br>-The Republican Party has yet to decide on a nominee, with a few high profile figures duking it out. Vice President Trump is the front runner, with senator Bob Dole in a close second, along with Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld in a distant third. With the Republican nominee yet to be chosen, it's fair to say it's anybody's game as to who it will be.\n</div>",
