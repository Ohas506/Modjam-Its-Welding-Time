He has since overseen almost a decade of inertia, and constant conflict with legislative Democrats, who currently have a supermajority. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, he is consistently rated as the most popular Governor in the country, with approval ratings that would make third world dictators blush. After overseeing a unanimously praised COVID response, benefitting from billions in federal dollars secured by the state's tenured congressional delegation on infrastructure and social projects, Governor Scott swatted aside two unserious attempts to dislodge him by absurd margins. The nation's most populous Governor seems poised to secure a fifth term with ease, securing the state's fiscal future on his terms in the midst of a crisis over education finance.

The man who deceived Vermont and became Governor by selling the idea of a friendly moderate, a problem solver, who then became the most obstructive Governor in the history of the state, ruthlessly advancing the deconstruction of state government at the bidding of scheming libertarian Chief of Staff Jason Gibbs. A man who somehow, despite everything, is for some reason beloved by an overwhelming majority of the state, a majority of Democrats. To conservative Republicans, Phil Scott is the ultimate sellout, the epitome of the RINO (Republican in Name Only), a liberal whose affiliation with the Republican Party is a formality and an accident. To outside observers, Phil Scott is a quaint oddity, a moderate Biden-voting Republican governing the country’s most liberal state, and nothing more. But for the majority of Vermonters, “Governor Nice Guy” has superseded politics, and has become something resembling a constitutional monarch. A symbol of their do-gooder spirit, spendthriftness, warmth, and exceptionalism.<br><br>For Phil Scott, he simply believes he is advancing the fundamental economic interests of the state. No matter what angry radicals on the left and right say, he believes his path is the right one. Growing the economy, making the state more affordable, and protecting the most vulnerable. Phil Scott presses ahead undaunted, although some say his message has become a tired one.<br></div></div></div></div></div>","color_hex":"#ff2600","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/46ao8Dx.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":true}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1002,"fields":{"first_name":"Vermont","last_name":"Republican Party","election":20,"party":"Republican","state":"Vermont","priority":1,"description":"The Vermont Republican Party is nothing more than a joke.

He rails against Elon Musk and Benjamin Netanyahu on Twitter, he asks if Donald Trump is on cocaine. In 2004, he declared himself to be on the “democratic wing of the Democratic Party”, tearing into the George W. Bush administration and the Iraq War in a presidential campaign that captured the aspirations of insurgent liberalism that eventually catapulted Barack Obama into the White House. It is perhaps ironic then that as Governor of Vermont for over ten years, he frustrated the left to no end. He sought to slash taxes and reduce spending, he gained a reputation for fiscal hawkishness that endeared him to Republicans. But he also courted controversy when he signed civil union legislation into law and fearlessly pushed for expansion of public healthcare access.<br><br>In any case, that was all supposed to be history. Though he was a remarkably successful DNC Chairman, he did not receive a cabinet post in the Obama White House, and receded into the background of American political life, stepping forward only occasionally to endorse a candidate here and there. But Howard Dean was paying keen attention to the goings on in Vermont. Frustrated by the Scott Administration’s neglect of healthcare reform and intransigence over budget issues, Dean hears the call of action. He also knows something else. If he does not run, Scott’s re-election is a certainty. Though unimaginable to most, Howard Dean knows what he has to do. And that is to take back his old job in 2024.<br><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>","color_hex":"#0000ff","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/QMLFM4N.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":true}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1004,"fields":{"first_name":"Vermont ","last_name":"Democratic Party","election":20,"party":"Democrat","state":"Vermont","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'>Once on the margins of Vermont politics in its halcyon days as a one-party Republican state, the Vermont Democratic Party now dominates the Green Mountain state, electing five Governors and holding state house majorities almost uninterrupted since 1964.
