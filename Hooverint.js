You've always been eager to prove the New Dealers wrong, show the nation that arch Conservatism is the way, and to vindicate yourself for the History books. Thus you announced your willingness to accept the Republican nomination if offered it, a decision that you quite honestly thought you'd never have to entertain. <br><br>But here you are now.
