Weld's win in Massachusetts was a shock to many in the nation, as what was considered to be a deep Blue State had just elected its first Republican Governor in almost a century. <br><br>Weld's win was no doubt partly due to his more liberal views on social issues, most notably his support for Abortion and protections for Gay people. These views were a source of attacks during the primary season, and with Buchanans entering the race, these attacks aren't going anywhere. Despite this, Weld strikes a different cord than past GOP leaders, he's much more liberal socially, much younger than Bush or Reagan, and he's never served in any elected position in Washington. Weld's path to victory lies with channelling his image as a \"New Republican\", while shoring up voters on his right flank from jumping ship to Buchanan.\n",
